hi i'm [hazel](https://hazel.virdo.name) \o

as [gretchen]({{< relref "gretchen" >}}) beautifully said, language is humanityâ€™s most spectacular open source project, so i suppose [this site](https://github.com/hazel-nut/puz-zel) is part of my contribution.

my puzzles are heavy on word play, video games, tech, sexuality, and contemporary language, but light on sports, actors from the 1950s, and proper nouns in general. most of them will probably be nsfw to some degree or another.

i prefer making & solving themed puzzles over themeless ones. (read: how do you even make a good themeless puzzle? it is a mystery.)
