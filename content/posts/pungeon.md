my long-time friend Kirr has constructed an impressive debut puzzle that i'm happy to be hosting as the first guest post on puz-zel. in their words:

> I really enjoyed Hazel's [first puzzle on this site]({{< relref "gretchen" >}})â€”enough that it inspired me to take a stab at constructing one of my own! Here's the result!

Kirr's voice, with all its clever wordplay and cheeky humor, comes right through in their puzzle. add that to the playful theme (and the lack of proper nouns in the fill) and, naturally, i loved it. i hope you do, too.

[Kirr](https://fetlife.com/users/27238) has all my encouragement to keep constructing, especially with a puzzle this great right out of the gate.
